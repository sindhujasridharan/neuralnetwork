# painter-by-numbers-neural-network

The project is based on the Kaggle competition “Painter by numbers”. In today’s world, art forgery is a very big concern because famous paintings are sold for millions of dollars. Identifying authentic artwork is very important to avoid such forgeries. This project intends to train an algorithm to identify the paintings and predict the artist it belongs to. The implementation of the algorithm will be in R language.
